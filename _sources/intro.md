# Bio-image Analysis with Python

This collection of [Python](https://www.python.org/)
[jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are written for Python beginners who are interested in analysing images acquired using modern fluorescence microscopes. 
The journey starts with Python basics and introduces general concepts of bio-image analysis. 
Special emphasis is put on image data showing cells and nuclei forming tissues and organisms. 
Demonstrations of basic principles are done in two-dimensional image data and more sophisticated examples demonstrate the basic principles in three-dimensional image data, potentially also over time.


## Work-in-progress

In January 2022 I just pulled together all these notebooks in one repository. I will now in the following months reorganize their content and streamline transitions between the topics. I'm doing this in the open because I like receiving feedback early on. If you have interesting notebooks that fit in the topic, your pull-request is very welcome. Also if you experience any issues, please [get in touch](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/BioImageAnalysisNotebooks/issues). I'm just saying, this repository is work-in-progress and it will take some time. :-) 

Cheers,
